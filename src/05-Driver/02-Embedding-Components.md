# Embedding Components

While we can create a Single-Page Application (SPA), sometimes, we are still migrating from some framework to Halogen and we only want Halogen to work on a part of our page.

In such situations, we can "embed" the component by running it in specific element

We'll follow similar steps as before but instead wait for the desired element, a `div` element with the id, "targetContainer":
1. Wait for the page to load
2. Find the desired element via `querySelector`
3. Run our component as a child in that element

This typically looks like this:
```purescript
main :: Effect Unit
main =
    launchAff_ do
      awaitLoad
      targetElem <- selectElement' "could not find 'div#targetContainer'" $ QuerySelector "#targetContainer"
      runUI childComponent input targetElem
  where
    selectElement' :: String -> QuerySelector -> Aff HTMLElement
    selectElement' errorMessage query = do
      maybeElem <- selectElement query
      maybe (throwError (error errorMessage)) pure maybeElem
```

View both the next file and the corresponding HTML file (defined in the build command below).

```bash
spago bundle -m Driver.EmbeddingComponents -t assets/driver/embedding-components.js
parcel serve assets/driver/embedding-components.html -o embedding-components--parcelified.html --open
```
