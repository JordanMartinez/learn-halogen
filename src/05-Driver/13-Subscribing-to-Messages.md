# Subscribing To Messages

In this example, the top-level component will render a button that, when clicked, will raise a message to the driver. We'll subscribe to these message "events" using `io.subscribe`.

We'll add two `consumer`s to show how these can be configured:
- the first consumer will run only once when it receives the first message "event."
- the second consumer will run every time it receives a message "event."
