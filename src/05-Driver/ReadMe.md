# Driver

In this folder, we'll show how to use the VDOM's driver to do the following things:
- run the top-level component as a child in
    - the `body` element in a blank HTML page (e.g. if we were running an SPA)
    - a specific element in our HTML page (e.g. if we were in the process of migrating pieces of our code from one library/framework/language to PureScript and Halogen)
- query the top-level component using `request`- and `tell`-style queries
- remove a component after a given time

Similar to the parent-child relationships folder, each of the below section has a corresponding file(s) that explains this more.

## Running a component with `runUI`

Section's corresponding files:
- `Running-Components`
- `Embedding-Components`

To run our component, we use the `runUI` function from the `Halogen.VDOM.Driver` module, not the `Halogen.Aff.Driver` module.

However, `runUI` requires an HTML element that is the component's parent. Usually, this will be the `body` element.

Regardless of which element is used, the general process looks like this:
1. Wait for the page to load
2. Find the element that will be the top-level component's parent (usually, `body`)
3. Run the component

For example
```purescript
main :: Effect Unit
main =
  launchAff_ do
    awaitLoad
    targetElement <- -- function that finds the element
    runUI topLevelComponent topLevelComponentInput targetElement
```

Since `awaitLoad` and a function that finds the body are frequently used, we can combine these two together using `awaitBody`

```purescript
main :: Effect Unit
main =
  launchAff_ do
    body <- awaitBody
    runUI topLevelComponent topLevelComponentInput body
```

## Communicating with the top-level component via the `HalogenIO` type (a record)

`runUI` returns a record with the type, `HalogenIO`:

```purescript
main :: Effect Unit
main =
    launchAff_ do
      body <- awaitBody
      io <- runUI topLevelComponent input body

      io.entityName
```

This record stores three entities. Each is described below:
1. `io.query`: Send `request`- and `tell`-style queries into the top-level component as though we are a parent component
2. `io.dispose`: Remove the top-level component from the target element and clean up any resources
3. `io.subscribe`: Subscribe to the messages the top-level component raises

### Sending Queries into the Top-Level Component

Section's corresponding files: `Querying-Components`

We can query the top-level component as though it were a child component. There are two differences from how a parent queries its child:
- In this situation, we use `io.query` instead of `H.query`
- In this situation, we do not need to add the `_childLabel childIndex` values as arguments to the `query` function. Since there can only be one top-level component per `HalogenIO` record value, the 'child' in question is obvious.

For example:
```purescript
main :: Effect Unit
main =
    launchAff_ do
      body <- awaitBody
      io <- runUI topLevelComponent input body

      -- run a request-style query
      requestResult <- io.query $ H.request $ GetInfoFromChild

      -- run a tell-style query
      tellResult <- io.query $ H.tell $ TellChildSomething 4
```

### Disposing a Top-Level Component

Section's corresponding files: `Disposing-Components`

Sometimes, we want to remove a top-level component after it's fulfilled its purposes. Perhaps we have a top-level application component that we want to separate from a top-level "loading" component. In such a case, we could render the 'loading' component and then remove it and replace it with the 'application' component.

To remove a top-level component and cleanup any resources it used, we use `io.dispose`.

For example:
```purescript
main :: Effect Unit
main =
    launchAff_ do
      body <- awaitBody
      io <- runUI topLevelComponent input body

      -- do stuff with our component for a while....

      -- now remove it
      io.dispose
```

### Subscribing to Messages Raised by the Top-Level Component
