# Basic Container

In this example, you will define a parent-like component that will be given a child component to render. Both the parent and child will be static HTML components. They will not respond to `input` values, raise `messages`, or have any `action`s. Again, we'll be hiding some of the configuration from you for now until we have explained how it works.

Now look at the next file for the full example.
