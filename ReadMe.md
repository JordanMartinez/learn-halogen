# Learn Halogen

Learn [`purescript-halogen`](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen), (`v5.0.0-rc.4`) from a bottom-up approach

## Requirements

Before learning Halogen via this project, you will need to install the following. (If you don't have them already installed, see my purescript learning repo's [Install Guide](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference/blob/latestRelease/00-Getting-Started/02-Install-Guide.md)
- purescript (v0.12.5)
- spago (v0.7.5.0)
- parcel (v1.12.3)
- dhall-to-json

## Instructions

1. Git clone this project
2. Run `spago build`
3. Run `spago docs` (and refer to the docs via the `./generated-docs/index.html` file)
4. Read through each folder using the same rules that I use in my learning repo (described [in the third bullet point here](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference#learning-purescript-using-this-project)

Note: ignore the `Scaffolding` folders. These wrap `halogen` code that haven't been explained yet to make it easier for you to understand foundational concepts and play with those concepts without bigger type issues getting in the way.
